# Air-Pollution Insights
Air Quality Index (AQI) is used by goverment agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.


AQI information is obtained by averaging readings from an air quality sensor, which can increase due to vehicle traffic, forest fires, or anything that can increase air pollution.


Public health risks increase as the AQI rises, especially affecting children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory or cardiovascular issues.
During those times, govermental bodies generally encourage people to reduce physical activity outdoors, or even avoid going out altogether. The use of cloth masks may also be recommended.


## Categorization standard used in the dataset:
Good(green) - 0 to 50 - Air quality is satisfactory and air pollution poses little or no risk.
Moderate(yellow) - 51 to 100 - Air quality is acceptable. However, there may be a risk for some people.
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups(orange) - 101 to 150 - Members of this group may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to get affected.
Unhealthy(red) - 151 to 200 - Some members of general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
Very Unhealthy(purple) - 201 to 300 - Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone.
Hazardous(Maroon) - 301 and higher - Health warning of emergency conditions: everyone is more likely to be affected.
